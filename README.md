# Server-Side-APIs-Challenge-Weather-Dashboard

For this assignment I started with of course adding very basic HTML and CSS attributes. Then I collected my api key from the given website. After that was done I console.log-ed the information that was given to me through the web api. In that console I was able to find the min and max values of the temp for the day. After getting that information I made the 5 day forecast chart appear on the page the way I wanted it to, so that way when the data is displayed it is not just all over the place.
